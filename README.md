**Progress: 90%**

This repo contains numerous projects I built whilst taking the [100 days of code](https://www.udemy.com/course/100-days-of-code/) course. During the course, over 60 hours of video lectures were presented by Dr. Angela Yu, a lead instructor at the London App Brewery, and a former instructor at such companies as Twitter, Facebook, and Google.

I have divided this repo into 4 sections [Applications](https://github.com/Steven-Klavins/Python-Bootcamp-2022/tree/main/Applications), [Games](https://github.com/Steven-Klavins/Python-Bootcamp-2022/tree/main/Games), [Kata Challenges](https://github.com/Steven-Klavins/Python-Bootcamp-2022/tree/main/Kata%20Challenges) and [Web Apps](https://github.com/Steven-Klavins/Python-Bootcamp-2022/tree/main/Web%20Apps).
